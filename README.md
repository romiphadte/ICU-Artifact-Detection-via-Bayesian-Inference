CU Artifact Detection via Bayesian Inference
================

Exploring the use of probabilistic modeling to analyze data, specifically arterial blood pressure (ABP) and intracranial pressure (ICP) of head trauma patients, from hospital intensive care units (ICUs). Conventional bedside instruments using data-driven algorithms to track the status of a patient can yield a false alarm rate as high as 90% [Aleks et al., 2009]. Expanding upon the existing work of Norm Aleks, Stuart Russell, Michael G. Madden, and others, we use Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBN) and Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods to reduce false alarm rates by inferring various artifacts in ABP and ICP data.
