Thoughts and Questions:

1. Properly sampling from this many particles in a reasonable amount of time?

2. Properly giving weights to each particle?

3. Do we want to discretize our particle states so we are able to actually have
    many particles in the same state? Otherwise our weights will all be one.

4. Why do all particles have a constant BP over time? And why does the noise only increase the BP?
